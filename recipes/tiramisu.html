    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tiramisu is an elegant and rich layered Italian dessert made with delicate
      ladyfinger cookies, espresso or instant espresso, mascarpone cheese, eggs,
      sugar and cocoa powder.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese ,room temperature</li>
      <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</li>
      <li>1 package Lady Fingers</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with
        electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and
        continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in
        until combined. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the
        coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them
        wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar
        size pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of
        dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to
        do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
